# Database Schema Design

The database follows normalization principles by separating student information and marks into different tables.

## Students Table

Stores student-related information.

| Column     | Description                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| id         | UUID Primary Key           |
| rollNumber | Unique Student Roll Number |
| name       | Student Name               |
| age        | Student Age                |
| grade      | Student Grade/Class        |
| createdAt  | Record Creation Timestamp  |
| updatedAt  | Record Update Timestamp    |

## Marks Table

Stores marks obtained by students in individual subjects.

| Column    | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| id        | UUID Primary Key          |
| studentId | Foreign Key Reference     |
| subject   | Subject Name              |
| score     | Marks Obtained            |
| createdAt | Record Creation Timestamp |

### Relationship

One Student → Many Marks

Example:

Student:

* John Doe

Marks:

* Math → 90
* Science → 85
* English → 95

### Design Decisions

* Student and Marks are stored separately to maintain normalization.
* UUIDs are used as primary keys.
* Roll Number is unique for each student.
* A student can have multiple subjects.
* Duplicate subjects for the same student are prevented using a composite unique constraint.
* Cascade delete ensures marks are automatically removed when a student is deleted.

# API Endpoints

## Create Student

POST /api/students

## Get All Students

GET /api/students

### Pagination Example

GET /api/students?page=1&limit=10

## Get Student By ID

GET /api/students/:id

Returns student information along with marks.

## Update Student

PUT /api/students/:id

## Delete Student

DELETE /api/students/:id

# Pagination Response

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "totalRecords": 50,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

# Assumptions

* Each student has a unique roll number.
* A student can have multiple subjects.
* A student cannot have duplicate entries for the same subject.
* Marks are stored separately for normalization.
* Pagination is implemented at the database level.

---

# Architecture Decisions

* Prisma ORM was chosen for type-safe database access.
* PostgreSQL was used because of its strong relational capabilities.
* Zod was used for request validation.
* Shared types and schemas were used to maintain consistency between frontend and backend.
* Service layer was introduced to separate business logic from controllers.
* Server-side pagination was implemented for scalability and performance.

# Future Improvements

* Authentication & Authorization
* Advanced Filtering
* Bulk Import via CSV
* Export to Excel
* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* Docker Support
* Role-Based Access Control
